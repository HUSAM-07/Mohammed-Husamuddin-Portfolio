# Website Technical Documentation

## Overview
This website is built using Next.js, a React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.

## Key Components

### Blog System
- Located in `src/app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`
- Uses dynamic routing to generate individual blog post pages
- Blog posts are likely stored as Markdown files in a `content/blog/` directory

### Data Fetching
- Blog post data is fetched using a `getPost` function from `@/data/blog`
- This function should read Markdown files and return structured data

### Metadata
- Each blog post should include metadata (title, publishedAt, summary, etc.)
- Metadata is used for SEO optimization and page rendering

## Publishing Process
1. Write blog posts in Markdown format
2. Add necessary metadata to each post
3. Place new posts in the designated content folder
4. Rebuild and redeploy the site to generate new static pages

## Development
- Use `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` to start the development server
- Make changes to components in the `src/` directory
- Test changes locally before deploying

## Deployment
- Build the project using `npm run build` or `yarn build`
- Deploy the resulting build to your hosting platform of choice

## SEO Optimization
- Utilizes Next.js built-in SEO features
- Custom metadata is set for each blog post

## Styling
- Likely uses CSS modules or a CSS-in-JS solution (confirm based on project structure)

## Future Improvements
- Implement a CMS for easier content management
- Add a search functionality for blog posts
- Implement pagination for the blog list page
